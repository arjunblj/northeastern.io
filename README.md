# Northeastern.io

Hi! Welcome to Northeastern.io. Hopefully over the course of the semester, we (Arjun and Luke) will get you from 0 to *n*, where *n* is a slightly more-technical, more-awesome version of yourself.

Whether you just want to build a simple personal site or want to build more complex web applications, we can help you get there over the course of the semester.
