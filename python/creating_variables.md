# Creating Variables and Using Basic Operations

It's time to write your first bit of Python.

Type ```x = 5``` and hit return.

This statement assigns the value ```5``` to the variable ```x```. Try typing ```print x``` and hitting return. It will print out the value associated with x (```5```).

You can redefine x to be anything you want. Try repeating the steps above with ```x = 8```.

Now, let's try doing some basic math.
```python
>>> x = 2 + 2
```
This statement will evaluate the expression ```2 + 2``` and store the result in x. Print the value of x once again using ```print x``` and you should see 4. Try some different operations like subtraction (```-```), multiplication (```*```), and division (```/```). Bonus points for checking out modulo (```%```), as well.

Pretty simple, right? But, we promised this wouldn't just work with numbers.

```python
>>> friend = "Bob"
>>> print friend
"Bob"
```
We can do some operations on these as well, such as
```python
>>> greeting = "Hi, " + friend
>>> print greeting
"Hi, Bob"
```

We're getting ahead of ourselves though. Let's get a better idea of how we can store different types of information in variables, first, and then return to these ideas.
