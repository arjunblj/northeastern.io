# Variables

Remember variables from Algebra? You'd get something like
```
Given the following equation, find y for x = 3, 4, and 5:

y = 5x + 3

```
The variable *x* can be any number we want here, and each value of x gives us some value for the variable *y*. This word *variable* just refers to the ability for *x* and *y* to represent *varying* values, quite obviously.

## But I hated Algebra...

That's ok. Variables are useful in lots of ways beyond math. Think about when you meet someone new.

You have a friend in math class (call him Bob) who despises (or adores) Algebra just as much as you do. In a way, your brain has now stored in the variable *Friend from math class* the name *Bob*. His name could have just as easily been *James* or *Theodore*, and you would act slightly differently to reflect that (greeting him with a different name, etc), but the general way you two interact would be mostly unchanged. In reality, the brain doesn't work quite like this, but it's a good way to think about it.

Enough analogies, though. Let's talk about variables for computers

>A variable is a way to store information in a program. This information can take the form of numbers, words, collections, and pretty much anything else.

We're going to play around with this idea right in Python.To do this, you'll need to open up the *Python interpreter*, a place where you can write and test snippets of Python code

On Linux/Mac:
* Open Terminal
* Type 'python' and hit enter


On Windows 8:
* In the charms prompt, search for and open 'cmd'
* Type 'python' and hit enter

On Windows 7:
* Press Start
* Go to run and type in 'cmd.exe', and hit enter
* Type 'python' and hit enter

If all went well, you should see three greater-than symbols (>>>) next to your cursor.
