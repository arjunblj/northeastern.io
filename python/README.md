# Python

By this point you know about 90% of the HTML and CSS concepts you'll need to get to your end result. You've built some personal pages, styled them to look super cool, and linked them together to make an ultra-simple, yet functional, website. Pat yourself on the back! You're doing a fantastic job!

But, that's not all there is to web development. You know from personal experience how long it takes to create and style just three HTML pages. Imagine if companies like Facebook and Twitter had to do the same for **every page** for **every user**. It would take an eternity.

Luckily, we have Python to simplify the work for us. In this chapter you'll learn the basics of writing programs in Python. The skills we'll discuss (making decisions, looping, etc) are almost universal to programming languages and will be valuable far beyond this class, so get excited.
