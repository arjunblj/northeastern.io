# Attributes

Congrats on making it to the third (and last) HTML-related term you'll have to learn!

Attributes are where the magic happens.

>Attributes are properties used to provide additional information about an element. The most common attributes include the id attribute, which identifies an element; the class attribute, which classifies an element; the src attribute, which specifies a source for embeddable content; and the href attribute, which provides a hyperlink reference to a linked resource.

>Attributes are defined within the opening tag, after an elementâ€™s name. Generally attributes include a name and a value. The format for these attributes consists of the attribute name followed by an equals sign and then a quoted attribute value.

For example, an `a` element including an href attribute would look like the following:

`<a href="http://northeastern.io/">yoloswag</a>`

which would create a link that looked like this: [yoloswag](http://northeastern.io/).
