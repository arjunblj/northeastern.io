# Recipe

One small project will be taking one of your favorite recipes (or blatantly copying one online, if you don't cook like me) and transcribing it into a HTML layout.

Here's one example of this:

Using images and different HTML elements, build a complete recipe you find online.

Send it to me! I need new flavor in my life.
