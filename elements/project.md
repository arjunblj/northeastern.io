# Project

Let's grind our teeth on a bigger project. One of the things that we're going to try to do is provide you with two different projects to learn the basics (HTML, CSS and Python), and later we'll continue to build on them into a larger web application.

The key with these projects is to avoid the temptation to copy-and-paste code, whether it's what you see here or something you see online.

The more you manually type out the different elements on your screen, the better you will get at identifying different elements and knowing what they mean.

If it helps, I recommend using flashcards for 5-10 minutes a day to drill yourself on basic HTML and CSS elements and properties. I find that [Anki](http://ankisrs.net/) is great as a spaced repetition tool (if you don't know what it is, check out the jump â€” it's a fantastic learning tool).
