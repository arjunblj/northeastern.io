# Personal Page

Hopefully this project will allow you to sink your teeth into it a bit more and be more creative. Get stoked — this is going to be your first multi-page masterpiece.

You can find a thousand arguments for why *personal branding* is so important to the millenial generation, so I won't make it. One of the most important things you can do towards that end is create your own personal website.

The great part about knowing basic HTML and CSS is that you'll be able to design and control how your site looks end-to-end.

I (Arjun) actually got my own start writing HTML/CSS to try to customize my MySpace page. That likely dated me a bit.

Anyway, let's get to it.

What composes a personal site? For starters, your site is going to consist of a few different pages:

* A home page — the first page visitors will hit. Let's call this `index.html` as is the convention (a remnant from the days where the first page you hit served as a directory, or index of *everything*). This will probably have: a large picture of you, a "Hi!" and maybe a small blurb.

* An "About Me" — I'd call this `about.html`, but use your imagination. Here, yo could talk a little bit more abour your interests, likes, dislikes and professional experience. Go wild.

* Pictures — you may or may not want this, but let's have a page of several different pictures.

If you have some alternative ideas about what you want to make, go for it! You should now know enough about HTML to hack through whatever basic page you want to make. If you still feel stuck, call or email me.

One of the powerful techniques we learned in a previous lesson was the art of linking different pages together. Try linking the different pages of your website together and test it out to see if it works!

BAM! What we'll do next is slowly learn how to *style* your site to make it as beautiful as you are.
