# Elements

>Elements are designators that define the structure and content of objects within a page. Some of the more frequently used elements include multiple levels of headings (identified as `h1` through `h6` elements) and paragraphs (identified as the `p` element); the list goes on to include the `a`, `div`, `span`, `strong`, and `em` elements, and many more.

>Elements are identified by the use of less-than and greater-than angle brackets, < >, surrounding the element name. Thus, an element will look like the following: `a`.

What are some elements on the page we created? One example of an element is the `h1` element. Play around with that â€” try replacing it with some HTML elements to see what they do (and try to guess before testing it!). Some common ones are: `b` and `i`.

The great part about web development is that a lot of learning comes out of just being curious and replacing text, saving it and trying it out! Don't be afraid to try new things. Worst case, CMD + Z is your best friend (or CTRL + Z for you silly Windows users).
