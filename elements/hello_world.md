# Hello World
We're going to begin by getting you set up with a text editor. While Notepad will do, I highly recommend getting an editor called [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/) â€” while their site may seem intimidating, the editor itself is actually quite simple to use, loaded with several helpful features for beginners.

Most introductory programming resources start with a "Hello world!" example. While what you're about to do may not make sense immediately off the bat, rest assured that in twenty minutes, it'll all click. :)

Start by opening up Sublime and creating a file called `hello.html`.

In it, paste the following:

```html
<html>
    <head>
        <title>
            My Website
        </title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
    </body>
</html>
```

After saving it, go ahead and try opening the file in your browser of choice.

It should look something like this:

If it does, congrats! You just made your very first web page.

We'll break down that code in a few sweet minutes.
