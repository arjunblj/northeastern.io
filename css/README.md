# Week 2: CSS

Now that you have a solid grasp on HTML, it's time to learn some CSS. CSS stands for *cascading style sheet*. While that's nice to know, it's far more useful to know what it does: help "style" the pages you made with HTML and prettify them. Think of HTML as where you define the structure, or layout, of the page and CSS as the bit that makes your sites pop.

This week, we'll learn the basics of CSS, hopefully enough to be dangerous (such that you can expand your knowledge to work on what you're interested in).

With this, you're going to take the personal page you made with HTML and turn it into the gorgeous page you were thinking of.
